  Explore and understand PUDL energy data: discover which tables exist, look up column
  meanings and usage warnings, and load Parquet files from S3 or a local directory.
  No PUDL Python package required. Use this skill whenever a user asks what PUDL data
  contains, wants to understand a specific table or column, asks about data quality or
  limitations, needs help loading data into a notebook or script, or wants to know
  which table covers a topic like electricity generation, utility financials, fuel
  costs, power plant locations, emissions, capacity factors, FERC financial data, or
  EIA survey data. Also use when the user mentions PUDL, Catalyst Cooperative energy
  data, or any of the specific data sources PUDL ingests (EIA-860, EIA-861, EIA-923,
  FERC Form 1, FERC Form 714, FERC EQR, EPA CEMS, EPA CAMD, etc.).

# PUDL Data Explorer Guide

This skill is for **data users** who want to explore, understand, and load PUDL's
public energy data products. It assumes no access to the PUDL Python package or source
repository — only the publicly distributed data files and their metadata.

PUDL's primary outputs are Apache Parquet files, described by a Frictionless Data
Package descriptor. For generic descriptor-querying patterns (jq, DuckDB JSON), use
the `datapackage` skill — this skill provides PUDL-specific knowledge layered on top.

Beyond the main Parquet outputs, PUDL also distributes FERC historical form databases
(SQLite and DuckDB, covering Forms 1/2/6/60/714) and the FERC EQR (partitioned Parquet,
separate from the main build). These have different access patterns and are not covered
by the main Frictionless descriptor — see [Data Access](./references/data-access.md)
for the full picture.

## Workflow overview

Most interactions only require steps 1–3. Steps 4 and 5 add real cost (computation,
potentially slow S3 downloads, extra dependencies) — only proceed to them when the
user explicitly asks to load or explore data.

1. **Locate the metadata** — the primary PUDL descriptor (Parquet outputs) is at:

   - S3: `s3://pudl.catalyst.coop/nightly/pudl_parquet_datapackage.json`
   - HTTPS: `https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/pudl.catalyst.coop/nightly/pudl_parquet_datapackage.json`

   FERC XBRL-derived tables have their own descriptors at the same base path:
   `ferc1_xbrl_datapackage.json`, `ferc2_xbrl_datapackage.json`,
   `ferc6_xbrl_datapackage.json`, `ferc60_xbrl_datapackage.json`,
   `ferc714_xbrl_datapackage.json`

   The FERC EQR (Electric Quarterly Reports) is distributed separately due to its
   size, and only one version is publicly available at a time:

   - S3: `s3://pudl.catalyst.coop/ferceqr/ferceqr_parquet_datapackage.json`
   - HTTPS: `https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/pudl.catalyst.coop/ferceqr/ferceqr_parquet_datapackage.json`

   For offline or development use, download all descriptors locally with:

   ```bash
   python scripts/fetch_descriptor.py
   ```

   This populates `assets/cache/` with fresh copies of all descriptors above.

   Raw input archives (for provenance) live at
   `s3://pudl.catalyst.coop/zenodo/<dataset>/<doi>/datapackage.json` — see
   [Data Quality and Context](./references/data-quality-and-context.md) for details.

1. **Query metadata selectively** — use `/datapackage` skill patterns (jq or DuckDB)
   to find relevant tables, read descriptions, and surface warnings.

1. **Check table tier** — see [Data Quality and Context](./references/data-quality-and-context.md).
   Prefer `out_*` tables; warn users about `_core_*` tables.

1. *(Only if the user explicitly asks to load data)* **Load the data** — Parquet from
   S3 or local. See [Data Access](./references/data-access.md).

1. *(Only if the user explicitly asks for interactive exploration)* **Delegate EDA to
   a notebook agent** — hand off to `/marimo-pair` (Marimo) or appropriate Jupyter
   agent.

## Reference index

- [Data Sources](./references/data-sources.md) — exhaustive list of all ~29 dataset
  short codes, full names, and per-source documentation links; read when a user asks
  about a specific source dataset (EIA-860, FERC Form 714, EPA CEMS, etc.) or needs
  documentation links, or when constructing a Zenodo DOI path and you need the short code
- [Data Access](./references/data-access.md) — S3 paths, loading patterns
  (pandas/DuckDB/polars/pure SQL), FERC historical database locations, and EQR access;
  read whenever generating data-loading code or explaining how to access any PUDL output
- [Data Quality and Context](./references/data-quality-and-context.md) — table tier
  naming conventions (`out_*` vs `core_*` vs raw), warning types, and what each tier
  means for analysis reliability; read when a user asks about data quality, when choosing
  between table tiers, or when surfacing warnings before providing loading code
- [Methodology](./references/methodology.md) — index of PUDL's data processing and
  modeling methodology pages (entity resolution, timeseries imputation, ownership
  extraction); read when a user asks *how* PUDL cleans, reconciles, or models data,
  then fetch the specific page URL to get the full description and summarize it
- [FERC Uniform System of Accounts](./references/ferc-uniform-system-of-accounts.md) —
  complete hierarchical chart of FERC electric utility accounts (balance sheet, electric
  plant, operating revenue, O&M expenses) with account numbers and descriptions; read
  when interpreting FERC Form 1 financial data or when a user asks what a specific
  account number means — prefer querying `ferc_accounts.json` over reading this
  file
- [FERC Form 1 Schedules](./references/ferc1-schedules.md) — all 75 Form 1 schedules
  with titles, descriptions, and table mappings; read when a user references a schedule
  by number or name (e.g. "Schedule 301", "Page 400a", "plant in service schedule") —
  prefer querying `ferc1_schedules.json` over reading this file
- [ferc1_schedules.json](./assets/ferc1_schedules.json) — **query this first** for any
  FERC Form 1 schedule or table lookup; use jq or DuckDB `read_json()` to find
  schedules by keyword, account number, or PUDL table name without loading the full
  markdown into context
- [FERC Form 2 Schedules](./references/ferc2-schedules.md) — all 77 Form 2 schedules
  with titles, descriptions, and XBRL table mappings (Form 2 is not yet integrated into
  PUDL); read when a user references a Form 2 schedule or asks about natural gas
  pipeline financial or operational data — prefer querying `ferc2_schedules.json` over
  reading this file
- [ferc2_schedules.json](./assets/ferc2_schedules.json) — **query this first** for any
  FERC Form 2 schedule or table lookup; use jq or DuckDB `read_json()` to find
  schedules by keyword, account number, or XBRL table name without loading the full
  markdown into context
- [ferc_accounts.json](./assets/ferc_accounts.json) — **query this first** for any
  FERC account number lookup; use jq or DuckDB `read_json()` to resolve account
  definitions and cross-reference with Form 1 schedules via the `ferc_accounts` array

- The S3 bucket `s3://pudl.catalyst.coop` is **free and publicly accessible** — no
  AWS credentials needed.

- The Parquet path for any table is `s3://pudl.catalyst.coop/nightly/<table_name>.parquet`.

- **Always surface usage warnings** from the descriptor before providing loading code.

- **Prefer `out_*` tables** for analyst work. If a user asks about a topic without
  specifying a table, search metadata for `out_` tables first.

- **Use `uv` to install Python packages** — prefer `uv add <package>` over
  `pip install <package>`. `uv` is faster and installs into a virtual environment
  rather than globally. Fall back to `pip` only if `uv` is not available
  (`command -v uv` returns nothing).

- **Descriptor descriptions are ReStructuredText (RST)**, not plain text or Markdown.
  When reading `description` fields from the datapackage descriptor, apply these rules:

  - Sphinx inline roles like `:py:class:`, `:py:func:`, `:py:attr:` — extract the
    name inside the backticks (e.g. `:py:func:\`pudl.helpers.fix_eia_na\``→`fix_eia_na\`).
  - `:ref:\`label\`\` cross-references do not resolve to accessible URLs; treat them
    as internal documentation pointers only — do not attempt to construct a URL.
  - `.. note::` and `.. warning::` directive blocks should be treated as callouts and
    surfaced to users when relevant.

### Cross-referencing FERC Form 1 and Form 2 schedules and accounts

Both `ferc1_schedules.json` and `ferc2_schedules.json` share the same schema. Each
record has a `ferc_accounts` array with the account numbers that schedule references,
pre-extracted for direct lookup. Use `description` for topical keyword search; use
`ferc_accounts` for account-number cross-referencing.

**Quick lookup patterns (jq):**

```bash
# Find all Form 1 schedules that reference a specific account number
jq '[.[] | select(.ferc_accounts[] == "182.3")] | .[] | {schedule, title}' \
	assets/ferc1_schedules.json

# Find all Form 2 schedules that reference a specific account number
jq '[.[] | select(.ferc_accounts[] == "489.2")] | .[] | {schedule, title}' \
	assets/ferc2_schedules.json

# Get all account definitions for a specific Form 1 schedule
SCHED="232"
jq --arg s "$SCHED" '.[] | select(.schedule == $s) | .ferc_accounts[]' \
	assets/ferc1_schedules.json |
	xargs -I{} jq --arg a {} '.[] | select(.account == $a)' assets/ferc_accounts.json
```

**Combined DuckDB query:**

```sql
-- Find PUDL tables and account definitions for a Form 1 topic (e.g. "regulatory assets")
SELECT s.schedule, s.title, unnest(s.pudl_tables) AS pudl_table,
       a.account, a.description AS account_description
FROM read_json('assets/ferc1_schedules.json') s,
     LATERAL unnest(s.ferc_accounts) AS t(acct)
JOIN read_json('assets/ferc_accounts.json') a ON a.account = t.acct
WHERE s.description ILIKE '%regulatory asset%'
ORDER BY s.schedule, a.account;

-- Find Form 2 XBRL tables for a topic (e.g. "storage")
SELECT schedule, title, unnest(xbrl_tables) AS xbrl_table
FROM read_json('assets/ferc2_schedules.json')
WHERE description ILIKE '%storage%'
ORDER BY schedule;
```
