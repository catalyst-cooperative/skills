# Data Access

## Use this when

- Loading PUDL tables in a script or notebook (Jupyter or Marimo).
- Choosing between S3 and a local copy.
- Generating reproducible data-loading code for a user.
- Deciding how to access raw FERC form data.

---

## Choosing local vs. remote data

**Always check for local data before defaulting to S3.** Remote queries are convenient
but can be slow on poor connections or with heavy usage. Follow this decision tree
every time you are about to generate data-loading code:

1. **Check environment variables** — run `echo $PUDL_OUTPUT` and `echo $PUDL_DATA`
   in the user's shell. If either is set and points to a directory that exists, it
   likely contains a local copy of the PUDL Parquet files:
   - `$PUDL_DATA` — the standard download location for the distributed Parquet bundle
   - `$PUDL_OUTPUT` — the output directory of a local PUDL pipeline run; Parquet
     files are under `$PUDL_OUTPUT/parquet/`

   If a local directory is found, ask the user: *"I found a local PUDL data directory
   at `<path>`. Would you like to read from there instead of S3?"*

2. **Ask if neither is set** — if neither variable is set (or neither points to a
   real directory), ask: *"Do you have a local copy of the PUDL data somewhere?
   If so, reading locally will be faster than S3."*

3. **Suggest downloading if queries are slow** — if you find yourself making many
   long or slow remote queries, suggest that the user download the full Parquet bundle:

   ```text
   https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/pudl.catalyst.coop/nightly/pudl_parquet.zip
   ```

   > **Size warning**: `pudl_parquet.zip` is approximately 10 GB. Ask the user where
   > they would like to save it before downloading.

   After downloading, suggest they set `$PUDL_DATA` to point at the unzipped
   directory so future sessions can find it automatically. Offer to add the export
   line to their shell startup file (e.g. `~/.zshrc`, `~/.bashrc`, or
   `~/.profile`) if you have permission to edit environment files.

4. **FERC raw databases** — the FERC DuckDB and SQLite files can also be downloaded
   for local use. Only suggest this if the user has already been querying them
   remotely in the current session — these are much messier than the processed PUDL
   Parquet outputs, so don't proactively recommend them.

## Data locations

All PUDL outputs — Parquet files, FERC SQLite/DuckDB databases, and descriptors — are
free and publicly accessible on AWS S3. No AWS credentials or account needed.

### Core PUDL outputs

| Location | Path pattern |
| --- | --- |
| S3 nightly (latest) | `s3://pudl.catalyst.coop/nightly/<table_name>.parquet` |
| S3 versioned | `s3://pudl.catalyst.coop/v2024.11.0/<table_name>.parquet` |
| Local download (`$PUDL_DATA`) | `$PUDL_DATA/<table_name>.parquet` |
| Local PUDL pipeline output (`$PUDL_OUTPUT`) | `$PUDL_OUTPUT/parquet/<table_name>.parquet` |

Datapackage JSON descriptors at the same base path: `pudl_parquet_datapackage.json`,
`ferc1_xbrl_datapackage.json`, `ferc2_xbrl_datapackage.json`,
`ferc6_xbrl_datapackage.json`, `ferc60_xbrl_datapackage.json`,
`ferc714_xbrl_datapackage.json`. If using local PUDL pipeline output, these databases
will be in the directory above the Parquet files: `$PUDL_OUTPUT/ferc1_xbrl_datapackage.json`,
etc.

**Use S3 nightly** for most exploratory work. For production pipelines or academic
citation, use a fixed versioned path (e.g. `v2024.11.0`) so results are reproducible
and the data never changes under you.

### FERC EQR (Electric Quarterly Reports / Form 920)

The FERC EQR dataset (also known as **FERC Form 920**) is distributed separately at
`s3://pudl.catalyst.coop/ferceqr/` due to its size. **Only one version is publicly
available at a time** — there is no versioned path.

EQR data is updated **monthly**: the pipeline runs at the start of each month and new
data typically appears by the 3rd day of the month.

EQR tables are **partitioned into quarterly Parquet files** inside a per-table directory:

```text
s3://pudl.catalyst.coop/ferceqr/<table_name>/<year>q<quarter>.parquet
```

Examples:

- `s3://pudl.catalyst.coop/ferceqr/core_ferceqr__transactions/2024q1.parquet`
- `s3://pudl.catalyst.coop/ferceqr/core_ferceqr__transactions/2013q3.parquet`

> **Size warning**: `core_ferceqr__transactions` is ~100 GB total; recent quarterly
> files are ~3.5 GB each as compressed Parquet. **Never load the full table into
> memory.** Load only the quarters you need, and push down column/row filters.
> Other EQR tables are tens to hundreds of MB.

**With DuckDB (pure SQL — no Python required):**

```sql
-- Attach the EQR descriptor (optional, for schema inspection)
-- Then query specific quarters directly
SELECT * FROM read_parquet(
    's3://pudl.catalyst.coop/ferceqr/core_ferceqr__transactions/2023q*.parquet'
)
WHERE report_year = 2023
LIMIT 1000;
```

Use the `/duckdb-skills` skill to run queries against EQR data — DuckDB can scan
Parquet files from S3 without downloading them.

**With polars (memory-efficient Python):**

```python
import polars as pl

# Load a single quarter
df = pl.scan_parquet(
    "s3://pudl.catalyst.coop/ferceqr/core_ferceqr__transactions/2023q1.parquet"
).select(["seller_name", "buyer_name", "transaction_quantity"]).collect()

# Load all quarters for a year using a glob
df = pl.scan_parquet(
    "s3://pudl.catalyst.coop/ferceqr/core_ferceqr__transactions/2023q*.parquet"
).collect()
```

Descriptor:

- S3: `s3://pudl.catalyst.coop/ferceqr/ferceqr_parquet_datapackage.json`
- HTTPS: `https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/pudl.catalyst.coop/ferceqr/ferceqr_parquet_datapackage.json`

## FERC historical form databases

FERC Forms 1, 2, 6, 60, and 714 span two distinct filing eras with different source
formats. PUDL converts these into databases published alongside the core Parquet
outputs at the same S3 base path.

### Reporting epochs

| Form | Legacy format | Legacy years | XBRL years |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Form 1 (Electric Utilities) | DBF | 1994–2020 | 2021–present |
| Form 2 (Interstate Gas Transmission Companies) | DBF | 1996–2020 | 2021–present |
| Form 6 (Oil Pipeline Companies) | DBF | 2000–2020 | 2021–present |
| Form 60 (Centralized Service Companies) | DBF | 2006–2020 | 2021–present |
| Form 714 (Electricity Balancing Authorities and Planning Areas) | CSV (DBF export) | 2006-2020 | 2021–present |

### PUDL integration status

Always check whether a PUDL integrated table exists before falling back to raw
databases. Integrated tables are cleaned, entity-resolved, and span all years with a
uniform schema.

- **FERC Form 1**: Only some schedules have been integrated. See
  [FERC Form 1 Schedules](./ferc1-schedules.md) for the per-schedule breakdown.
  For unintegrated Form 1 schedules, use the raw DBF or XBRL databases below.
  Only provide raw Form 1 data if a user **explicitly** requests it.
- **FERC Forms 2, 6, and 60**: None of this data has been integrated into PUDL.
  It is only available through the raw databases.
- **FERC Form 714**: Only the integrated PUDL tables span pre-2021 years.
  The legacy CSV files were not structured for general machine-readable extraction.
  Integrated Form 714 tables cover all electronic reporting years (2006–present).

### DBF-derived databases (pre-2021, Forms 1/2/6/60)

PUDL consolidates all DBF years for each form into a single SQLite database:

| Form | S3 path |
| --- | --- |
| Form 1 | `s3://pudl.catalyst.coop/nightly/ferc1_dbf.sqlite.zip` |
| Form 2 | `s3://pudl.catalyst.coop/nightly/ferc2_dbf.sqlite.zip` |
| Form 6 | `s3://pudl.catalyst.coop/nightly/ferc6_dbf.sqlite.zip` |
| Form 60 | `s3://pudl.catalyst.coop/nightly/ferc60_dbf.sqlite.zip` |

**No datapackage descriptors exist** for these databases — the original DBF files are
almost entirely undocumented. For Form 1, the [FERC Form 1 Schedules](./ferc1-schedules.md)
reference provides a hand-compiled schedule-to-table mapping. No equivalent mapping
exists for Forms 2, 6, or 60.

### XBRL-derived databases (2021–present, all forms)

PUDL converts XBRL filings into both SQLite and DuckDB:

| Form | DuckDB (preferred) | SQLite (zipped, must download) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Form 1 | `s3://pudl.catalyst.coop/nightly/ferc1_xbrl.duckdb` | `s3://pudl.catalyst.coop/nightly/ferc1_xbrl.sqlite.zip` |
| Form 2 | `s3://pudl.catalyst.coop/nightly/ferc2_xbrl.duckdb` | `s3://pudl.catalyst.coop/nightly/ferc2_xbrl.sqlite.zip` |
| Form 6 | `s3://pudl.catalyst.coop/nightly/ferc6_xbrl.duckdb` | `s3://pudl.catalyst.coop/nightly/ferc6_xbrl.sqlite.zip` |
| Form 60 | `s3://pudl.catalyst.coop/nightly/ferc60_xbrl.duckdb` | `s3://pudl.catalyst.coop/nightly/ferc60_xbrl.sqlite.zip` |
| Form 714 | `s3://pudl.catalyst.coop/nightly/ferc714_xbrl.duckdb` | `s3://pudl.catalyst.coop/nightly/ferc714_xbrl.sqlite.zip` |

**Prefer DuckDB**: DuckDB files can be queried remotely (see below) without
downloading. SQLite files are published as `.zip` archives, must be downloaded and
unzipped before use, and cannot be read remotely; some exceed 1 GB uncompressed.

Datapackage descriptors with table and column metadata exist for the XBRL databases:
`ferc1_xbrl_datapackage.json`, `ferc2_xbrl_datapackage.json`, etc., at the same S3
base path. There are three known issues with these descriptors:

1. **Absolute path bug**: the `path` field for each resource contains an absolute path
   from the build machine (e.g. `/home/user/pudl-work/ferc1_xbrl.sqlite`). Use only
   the final filename component to construct the actual S3 path.
2. **Points at SQLite, not DuckDB**: the `path` field always refers to the `.sqlite`
   file. Replace `.sqlite` with `.duckdb` to get the DuckDB path.
3. **Table descriptions are not useful**: they contain raw XBRL entity names rather
   than human-readable descriptions. Rely on the table name and column names instead.

### Querying XBRL databases with DuckDB

Use the `/duckdb-skills:attach-db` skill to attach and query an XBRL DuckDB file
directly from S3 without downloading. Pure SQL (no Python required):

```sql
-- Attach the Form 1 XBRL database
ATTACH 's3://pudl.catalyst.coop/nightly/ferc1_xbrl.duckdb' AS ferc1 (READ_ONLY);

-- List available tables
SHOW ALL TABLES;

-- Query a specific schedule table
SELECT * FROM ferc1.steam_electric_generating_plant_statistics_large_plants_402_duration
LIMIT 100;
```

Or from Python if needed:

```python
import duckdb

con = duckdb.connect()
con.execute(
    "ATTACH 's3://pudl.catalyst.coop/nightly/ferc1_xbrl.duckdb' AS ferc1 (READ_ONLY)"
)
df = con.execute(
    "SELECT * FROM ferc1.steam_electric_generating_plant_statistics_large_plants_402_duration LIMIT 100"
).df()
```

---

## Loading PUDL Parquet tables

### With pandas

```python
import pandas as pd

table = "out_eia923__generation"

# From S3 (no credentials needed)
df = pd.read_parquet(f"s3://pudl.catalyst.coop/nightly/{table}.parquet")

# From local file
df = pd.read_parquet(f"/path/to/pudl_parquet/{table}.parquet")

# Load only specific columns (much faster for large tables)
df = pd.read_parquet(
    f"s3://pudl.catalyst.coop/nightly/{table}.parquet",
    columns=["plant_id_eia", "report_date", "net_generation_mwh"],
)
```

`s3fs` must be installed for S3 access: `pip install s3fs` or `conda install s3fs`.

### With DuckDB (efficient for large tables or SQL-style queries)

Pure SQL (no Python required) — use `/duckdb-skills` to run these:

```sql
SELECT plant_id_eia, report_date, net_generation_mwh
FROM read_parquet('s3://pudl.catalyst.coop/nightly/out_eia923__generation.parquet')
WHERE report_date >= '2020-01-01'
LIMIT 1000;
```

Or from Python:

```python
import duckdb

result = duckdb.sql("""
    SELECT plant_id_eia, report_date, net_generation_mwh
    FROM read_parquet('s3://pudl.catalyst.coop/nightly/out_eia923__generation.parquet')
    WHERE report_date >= '2020-01-01'
    LIMIT 1000
""").df()  # .df() returns a pandas DataFrame; .pl() returns polars
```

DuckDB can scan Parquet files from S3 without downloading them. Useful for large
hourly tables (e.g., `out_ferc714__respondents_hourly`).

### With polars (memory-efficient alternative to pandas)

```python
import polars as pl

table = "out_eia923__generation"

lf = pl.scan_parquet(f"s3://pudl.catalyst.coop/nightly/{table}.parquet")
df = lf.select(["plant_id_eia", "report_date", "net_generation_mwh"]).collect()
```

Polars lazy evaluation (`scan_parquet`) is preferred for tables > 500 MB — it pushes
down column selection and row filters to the Parquet reader.

---

## Listing all available tables

```sql
-- Pure DuckDB SQL: list all Parquet tables in the nightly build
SELECT filename
FROM glob('s3://pudl.catalyst.coop/nightly/*.parquet');
```

Or with the AWS CLI:

```bash
aws s3 ls --no-sign-request s3://pudl.catalyst.coop/nightly/ | grep '\.parquet'
```

Or query the descriptor with jq (see the `datapackage` skill for full querying patterns):

```bash
jq -r '.resources[].name' pudl_parquet_datapackage.json
```

---

## Raw input archives (Zenodo)

**Do not surface this to users unless they explicitly ask about data provenance or
want to trace a value to its original source file.** Most users should use the
processed PUDL outputs instead.

Raw inputs are cached on S3 as a mirror of PUDL's Zenodo archives:

```text
s3://pudl.catalyst.coop/zenodo/<dataset>/<doi-path>/datapackage.json
```

Where `<dataset>` is the PUDL short code for the data source (see
[Data Sources](./data-sources.md) for the full list) and `<doi-path>` is the Zenodo
DOI with `/` replaced by `-`.

For example, for DOI `10.5281/zenodo.17091669`, the `<doi-path>` would be
`10.5281-zenodo.17091669`, giving:

```text
s3://pudl.catalyst.coop/zenodo/ferc1/10.5281-zenodo.17091669/datapackage.json
```

To construct a human-readable DOI URL from a Zenodo record ID (e.g. `19367768`):

```text
https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.<record_id>
# Example: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19367768
```
